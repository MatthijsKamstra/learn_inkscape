Learn how to use Inkscape (with a Illustrator/Papertoy background)

I have worked with Adobe Illustrator as long as I can remember. In my current position I don't have access to Illustrator unless I cough up the cash myself.

This gives me the unique situation for trying to switch to [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)

## Install

I use brew to install inkscape

```bash
brew install --cask inkscape # ðŸ‘ˆ inkscape: 1.2.2
```

And use the Illustrators shortcuts
